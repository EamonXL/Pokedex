## Pokedex Project

This is a personal project developed by myself for the purposes of understanding GUI along with improving my skills for front end development. I am passionate about both Pokemon and coding and am looking to continue developing my knowledge in both of these areas. The Pokedex Project creates a Pokedex and can be navigated to provide information for currently the first 151 original Pokemon.
